# CSCI124-CH14EXS
Programming Examples From C++ Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design by DS Malik
## Example Descriptions  
*Note: divisionByZero.h and myException.h are used in multiple projects, so they are not placed in a folder*  
**CH14EX01** - Division by zero when the problem is not addressed in the program  
**CH14EX02** - Updated so the program checks when the divisor is zero  
**CH14EX03** - This program uses the assert function to determine whether the divisor is zero  
**CH14EX05** - This program shows how a try/catch block may appear in a program  
**CH14EX06** - Same as EX05, except this throw statement throws the value of the variable divisor  
**CH14EX07** - This program shows how to handle division by zero, division by a negative integer, and input failure exceptions  
**CH14EX08** - Out of range and length error exceptions are shown in this program.  
**CH14EX09** - This program shows how to handle the bad_alloc exception thrown by the operator new  
**CH14EX10** - This program shows a user-defined exception class  
**CH14EX11** - How to use user-defined exception class divisionByZero.h with specific user message 
**CH14EX12** - Using divisionByZero.h with specific error message  
**CH14EX13** - How to handle an exception thrown by a function 
**CH14EX14** - In folder CH14EX14 there is a program to throw an exception if the user tries to set the radius of a circleType object to a negative number  
**CH14EX17** - This program continues to prompt the user until valid input is accepted
